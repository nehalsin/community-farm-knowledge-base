# Moderated Channel Benefits

Dear Member,

Thank you for joining this group. 

You are now invited to migrate to Telegram channel for the same, for better quality, curated posts  only after due moderation. 

Groups provide easy mechanism for p2p sharing, however it has been observed that unmoderated groups become easy gateway for irrelevant content posting that wastes precious time of members.

Please find link of Community Farming channel here: [https://t.me/communityfarming](https://t.me/communityfarming). 

Sorry for any inconveniences caused.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. 


Wishing you good learning and healthy experience in togetherness with the volunteer team and other members. :-)
