# Community Farm Knowledge Base

## BE THE CHANGE

Mother Nature provides ultimate healthy living environment.

What could be better than being with a vibrant community of fellow farmmates engaged in all kinds of novel experiments for learning and sustainability for ultimate healthy and fulfilling life with a purpose and message for the rest of humanity.

People from all walks of life, all ages and capacities are moving, at least partially to begin, to being a member of a low cost high quality life open farm based communities not very far, say 100 KM from city or about two hours of drive away.

Without much investment of time and resources, away from hustle and bustle of city, some start as weekend hobby and later on graduate to full time or a serious vocation as things evolve.

India too has its share of such community living experiences, and I am blessed to be associated with some of them through my humble contribution, as this Community Farm Knowledge Base providing solid logistical framework for, and with those who are on the fields in real action!
